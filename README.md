## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project I was interested in gaining a better understanding of the process of building ETL, NLP, and Machine Learning pipelines - with the actual model performance being secondary. This project does this by taking two CSV files containing information on messages sent during a disaster event. The relevant pipelines have been built for a machine learning model to then classify these messages.
